Put simply, Dr Bouman and others developed a series of algorithms that converted telescopic data into the historic photo shared by the world's media.

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a process or set of rules used to solve problems.

No single telescope is powerful enough to capture the black hole, so a network of eight was set up to so do using a technique called interferometry.

The data they captured was stored on hundreds of hard drives that were flown to central processing centres in Boston, US, and Bonn, Germany.

Dr Bouman's method of processing this raw data was said to be instrumental in the creation of the striking image.

She spearheaded a testing process whereby multiple algorithms with "different assumptions built into them" attempted to recover a photo from the data.

The results of the algorithms were then analysed by four separate teams to build confidence in the veracity of their findings.

"We're a melting pot of astronomers, physicists, mathematicians and engineers, and that's what it took to achieve something once thought impossible," Dr Bouman says
