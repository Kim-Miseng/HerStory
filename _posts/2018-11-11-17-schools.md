### A 29-year-old computer scientist has earned plaudits worldwide for helping develop the algorithm that created the first-ever image of a black hole.

### Katie Bouman led development of a computer program that made the breakthrough image possible.

### The remarkable photo, showing a halo of dust and gas 500 million trillion km from Earth, was released on Wednesday.

### For Dr Bouman, its creation was the realisation of an endeavour previously thought impossible.

### Excitedly bracing herself for the groundbreaking moment, Dr Bouman was pictured loading the image on her laptop.

### "Watching in disbelief as the first image I ever made of a black hole was in the process of being reconstructed," she wrote in the caption to the Facebook post.

### She started making the algorithm three years ago while she was a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

### There, she led the project, assisted by a team from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the MIT Haystack Observatory.

### The black hole image, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) - a network of eight linked telescopes - was rendered by Dr Bouman's algorithm.
