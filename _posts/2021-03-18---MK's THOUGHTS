**Original work from Miseng.K**


## Through out the history, many female scientists had made contributions to fields of all sorts. They changed the world while tolerating sexists and pressure from their surroundings. However, they didn't quit, they continued to chase their dreams and made our world a better place. We should pay respect to these female scientists, for their bravery, independence, and their contributions to the humankind.

## Girls can do things that boys do, and boys can also do things that girls do. Gender should not be the factor that limits one's potencial of doing great things. All humans have their rights to chase their dreams and make them come true.
